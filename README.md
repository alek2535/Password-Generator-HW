# Password-Generator

## Description

The purpose of this project is to create a password generator by using JavaScript. The password will be generated using inputs selected by the user. The user is able to choose if their password will contain lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, or special characters as well as the length of the password. Producing random, criteria driven passwords are useful for those that need to protect sensitive data. 

### Logic for Building Generator

```
GIVEN a user needs a new, secure password
WHEN a user clicks the button to generate a password
THEN the user is presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN the user selects which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN the user chooses a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN the user chooses lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN the user answers each prompt
THEN the user's input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```
